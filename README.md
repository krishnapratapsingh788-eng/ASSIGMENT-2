📘 Python Tasks – README
🧠 Overview
This project contains two simple Python programs:
Checking whether a number is even or odd
Calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to 50
These tasks help beginners understand input handling, conditional statements, loops, and arithmetic operations in Python.


📝 Task 1: Even or Odd Number Checker
🔹 Description
This program asks the user to enter a number and checks whether the number is even or odd using the modulo (%) operator.
🔹 How It Works
The user inputs an integer.
If the number is divisible by 2, it is even.
Otherwise, it is odd.


Task 2: Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50
🔹 Description
This program calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 50 using a for loop.
🔹 How It Works
A variable total is initialized to 0.
A loop runs from 1 to 50.
Each number is added to total.
The final sum is printed.
